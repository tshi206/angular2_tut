  // Unlike middleware in Express where URLs are mapped via prefix,
  //  e.g., middleware that maps to '/abc' can also handle '/abc/def/...'
  //  Angular uses EXACT-MATCH in mapping routes to components.
  // Hence DirectoryComponent is overloaded by two URls.
  //  Using Angular's Router, a component that maps to '/abc' can ONLY handle '/abc',
  //  it CANNOT handle any url follows the pattern such as '/abc/def'

  { path: 'directory/:ninja', component: DirectoryComponent}, // url: '/directory/:ninja'
